# frozen_string_literal: true

# A class responsible for identifying hathifiles that have not yet been loaded into the
# `hathifiles` database.
#
# It computes a delta between the files in `HATHIFILES_DIR` and those recorded in the
# `hathifiles.hf_log` table.
#
# The most recent monthly "full" file is used as a waypoint -- we are not interested in
# any "upd" files older than it.
#
# Note: the two public methods `missing_full_hathifiles` and `missing_update_hathifiles`
# return Arrays of filenames, not paths. Internally we try to use basenames instead of
# paths as much as possible, just to cut out some of the noise.
